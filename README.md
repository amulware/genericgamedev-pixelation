# GameDev<T> Pixelation

This is the example project for my post on post processing pixelation [on my blog](http://genericgamedev.com/effects/post-processing-pixelation).

The example is written in C#, using [my own graphics library](https://github.com/amulware/awgraphics) and OpenTK to access OpenGL.

It shows two different ways of pixelating an image using a GLSL shader.

For an explanation and in-depth write-up of the techniques, please see the post at:
